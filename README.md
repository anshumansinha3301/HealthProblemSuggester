# ü©∫ HealthProblemSuggester 

**HealthProblemSuggester** is a Python project designed to help users **identify potential health issues based on symptom descriptions**. Many people are unsure about what type of health problem they may have when they experience symptoms like cough, headache, chest pain, or fatigue. This tool allows users to **input their symptoms in natural language** and provides **suggestions for possible health problems**, along with **confidence scores, descriptions, and actionable advice**.

The dynamic version of this tool distinguishes between **normal/common health issues** and **serious conditions**. If the user provides **minimal or simple symptoms**, it suggests **common problems** such as cold, viral infections, or indigestion. If the input is **detailed or includes multiple concerning symptoms**, it can identify **serious health issues** like heart problems, respiratory conditions, neurological disorders, or musculoskeletal pain. The system assigns a **confidence score** to each suggested problem based on the number and severity of matched symptoms, making the output **more precise and informative**.

**HealthProblemSuggester ‚Äì Dynamic Version** is fully contained in a **single Python file**, making it easy to run in **any online Python compiler**. It is ideal for students, developers, and healthcare enthusiasts who want to create a **practical, real-world, problem-solving application** in the health domain.
